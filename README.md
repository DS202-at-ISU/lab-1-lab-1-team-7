# 12.5: Push your local changes online to GitHub

In pushing the local commit to the git repository, we encountered no
issues. We used both the Graphical User Interface and the RStudio
command line to try this process and both were successful.

# 12.6: Confirm the local change propagated to the GitHub remote

We both confirmed our changes went through smoothly. Each of us saw our
edit appear in the GitHub repository and not interfere with the other’s
addition.
