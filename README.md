# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

# 12.5: Push your local changes online to GitHub

In pushing the local commit to the git repository, we encountered no
issues. We used both the Graphical User Interface and the RStudio
command line to try this process and both were successful.

# 12.6: Confirm the local change propagated to the GitHub remote

We both confirmed our changes went through smoothly. Each of us saw our
edit appear in the GitHub repository and not interfere with the otherâ€™s
addition.
